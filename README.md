# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5 - Data visualization using Matplotlib, SciPy, and NumPy

# Overview of the Analysis
The objective of this analysis project is to analyze the Pyber ride sharing company to identify opportunities to optimize access to their ride sharing services for various types of cities. The project scope involved performing exploratory analysis of several large files containing city and ridership data and creating several types of visualizations to create a compelling story about the data and provide recommendations.

The analysis examined the relationship of cities and number of drivers and riders, as well as revenue per driver and rides by city type, the percentage of total fares, drivers and riders by type of city. Combined with the analysis, the data visualization will help Pyber improve access to ride sharing services and determine afforability for underserved neighborhoods.

This project used python script, Pandas library, Jupyter Notebook and matplotlib to create a variety of charts.
