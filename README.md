# PyBer Analysis Report

## Project Overview and Objective
The objective of this analysis project is to analyze the Pyber ride sharing company to identify opportunities to optimize access to their ride sharing services for various types of cities. The project scope involved performing exploratory analysis of several large files containing city and ridership data and creating several types of visualizations to create a compelling story about the data and provide recommendations.

The analysis examined the relationship of cities and number of drivers and riders, as well as revenue per driver and rides by city type, the percentage of total fares, drivers and riders by type of city. The combined data analysis and visualization can be utilized by the Pyber CEO to identify oppotunities and strategies to improve access to ride sharing services and determine ride fare afforability for underserved neighborhoods.

This project used python script, Pandas library, Jupyter Notebook and matplotlib to create a variety of charts.


# Results
The table of ride sharing data by city type shown below summarizes the average fare per ride and average fare by driver by city type.

# Summary

Urban cities have a higher number of rides and drivers. However, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver are the lowest among other city types. A higher number On the other hand, rural tities show the lowest number of total rides and drivers, and unlike the urban cities, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver are the highest. This results could be linked to the distance per ride. Rides in rural cities could cover longer distances and because of that, the fares per ride and driver are higher. In urban cities, distances between the start and the end of the ride might be shorter.
