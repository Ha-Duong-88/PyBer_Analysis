# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5 - Data visualization using Matplotlib, SciPy, and NumPy

# Overview of the Analysis
The objective of this analysis project is to analyze the Pyber ride sharing company to identify opportunities to optimize access to their ride sharing services for various types of cities. This scope of the project involves doing exploratory analysis of several large CSV files and creating several types of visualizations to tell a compelling story about the data.

The analysis will examine the relationship of cities and number of drivers and riders, as well as percentage of total fares, drivers and riders by type of city.
Combined with the analysis, the data visualization will help Pyber improve access to ride sharing services and determine afforability for underserved neighborhoods.

In this project used python script using Pandas library, Jupyter Notebook and matplotlib to create a variety of charts.
